                          <p>I've made my home base in Banbury, Oxfordshire, with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a desire to have more freedom and flexibility in my work, something that would fit around the demands of family life. I started to explore various different avenues, I was fascinated with the booming online market and the ever growing demands for IT skills, and so begun training in web development.</p>

                          <p>I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build websites from scratch. That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I'm in the process of making a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
